USER INSTRUCTIONS: Click anywhere on the screen to create your own puddles. There are 3 different modes - Press 1, 2 or 3 on the keyboard to see the different variations. You can make your own puddles on all 3.

Description: The elements I have are random circles/puddles on the screen. These puddles have a restrained random x and y coordinate, and are drawn on the screen one after a another, appearing in random areas. The puddles can also overlap depending on their diameter, fade value, and location as well, which helps to make it emulate puddles that form when it rains. The interactive element is the user's mode, and the users own puddles. Much like the random puddles, the user puddle also has a diaemeter and fade value, but the fade value is differet, so puddles appear larger than the ramdomized puddles. The user puddles are also colored differently, to distinguish them from the randomized puddle, which also adds a more asethicly pleasing element. Each mode has its own theme, which creates more interactivity and adds a small elememnt of fun.
